# ShapeGUI
This is my version of the shapes project.

The assignment was to simply implement some inheritance with a CLI. 
I thought it would be interesting to throw a GUI on top of our shapes classes (circles, triangles, etc)
The GUI does not change anything about the original assignment, it's simply an extension. 
If you uncomment the main method in [ShapeTester.java](https://github.com/nsporillo/ShapeGUI/blob/master/src/net/porillo/ShapeTester.java), you can use the CLI version.


This repository was created so my source is easily browsable by anyone.
